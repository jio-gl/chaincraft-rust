# ChainCraft Rust: Next Steps for Publication

This document summarizes what has been completed and what remains to be done for the full publication of the ChainCraft Rust project.

## Completed Tasks

### Repository Setup
- ✅ Created `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for continuous integration
- ✅ Created `.github/workflows/release.yml` for automated publishing
- ✅ Created `.cargo/config.toml` for build optimization
- ✅ Set up initial tag `v0.1.0` for release
- ✅ Created guides for GitHub repository setup and release verification
- ✅ Fixed code quality issues in several files
- ✅ Updated repository URLs in Cargo.toml

### Documentation
- ✅ Updated guides for setting up GitHub repository
- ✅ Added detailed release verification process
- ✅ Created comprehensive README.md and other documentation

## Pending Tasks

### Repository Configuration
- [ ] Configure repository secrets:
  - [ ] Add `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` for crates.io publishing
  - [ ] Add `CODECOV_TOKEN` for code coverage reporting (optional)
- [ ] Set up branch protection rules for the `main` branch
- [ ] Configure GitHub Pages for documentation

### Organization Transfer (When Ready)
- [ ] Create `chaincraft-org` organization on GitHub
- [ ] Transfer repository to the organization
- [ ] Update repository URLs in Cargo.toml after transfer
- [ ] Re-configure branch protection and secrets in the new repository

### Verification
- [ ] Verify GitHub release was created successfully
- [ ] Verify publishing to crates.io (if `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` is set)
- [ ] Verify documentation appears on docs.rs
- [ ] Test installation with `cargo install chaincraft-rust`

### Code Quality
- [ ] Address remaining linter errors and warnings
- [ ] Ensure all tests pass reliably

## Next Immediate Steps

1. Visit the [GitHub Actions tab](https://github.com/jio-gl/chaincraft-rust/actions) to check if the release workflow triggered by the `v0.1.0` tag is running
2. Check the [Releases page](https://github.com/jio-gl/chaincraft-rust/releases) to verify if a release was created
3. Configure the repository secrets for publishing to crates.io
4. Set up branch protection rules as outlined in the `GITHUB_SETUP.md` guide

## Long-term Maintenance

After completing the initial publication, consider:

1. Creating a roadmap for future features and improvements
2. Setting up a regular release schedule
3. Establishing contribution guidelines for the community
4. Planning for the eventual transfer to the `chaincraft-org` organization
